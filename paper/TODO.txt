Finish section on NUV COS luminosities systematically lower than 
GALEX. IS THIS CORRECTED FOR VIGNETTING? 

- measure LIS velocity offsets and compare with Heckman et al papers

- compute asymmetries. 

- I presume the FUV 1/2 light radius correlates with L(Lya) and L(FUV) 
	just through the size luminosity relation, but does it correlate with 
	EW(COS) / EW(GALEX) ?  I.e. do we sytematically lose more Lya as galaxies
	get bigger? 


- FOUR cannot calibratate Lambda
