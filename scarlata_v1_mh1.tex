\section{Introduction}
We use a standard $H_0 = 70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_M = 0.3$,
and $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$ cosmology.

\section{The sample}
The targets for the HST COS spectroscopic followup are taken from the
sample of \lya\ emitters identified by Deharveng et al.\ (2008) and
Cowie et al.\ (2010) in deep GALEX grism spectroscopy. The GALEX
sample includes 119 \lya\ emitters, 49 of which have rest-frame \lya\
emission line EW $>20$\AA.  From the parent sample of GALEX \lya\
emitters, we originally selected 25 galaxies that satisfied the
following criteria: 1) are classified as star-forming based on optical
emission line ratios (e.g., Cowie et al. 2010), 2) have \lya\ emission
line rest--frame EW$>20$~\AA\ in the low resolution GALEX spectra, and
3) have redshift confirmed using optical spectroscopy.  As we show in
Scarlata et al.\ (2009), Atek et al.\ (2009), Finkelstein et
al. (2009), and Cowie et al.\ (2010), the requirement of having the
optical confirmation does not change the target selection function of
the sample, since 100\% of the sources we followed up were, in fact,
confirmed.  % Focusing here on the \lya\ emission-line profile in
% star-forming galaxies, we removed those emitters with optical line
  % ratios consistent with an AGN, using the Baldwin, Phillips, \&
% Terlevich (BPT, 1981) diagram. 
High redshift \lya\ emitters are usually selected with Hu et al.'s
(1998) definition that they have a rest frame EW greater than
$20$~\AA\ (see also Kornei et al. 2010). Thus, the EW cut ensures that
we are able to make a valid comparison with the samples of \lya\
emitters selected at $z>2$. 

\citet{deharveng2008} identified broad-line AGN in their sample of
\lya\ emitters as those objects with \lya\ line widths broader than
1200 \kms. Narrow line AGN could not be identified since other
diagnostic lines of AGN activity % (such as \civ\ and \ciii)
were either too faint, or fell in a noisy part of the UV spectra.  In
order to identify the narrow line AGN, we have used the classic
\citet[][BPT]{baldwin1981} diagram of \oiii/\hb\ versus \nii/\ha
(shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{bpt.ps}
  \caption{BPT diagram }
  \label{fig:bpt}
\end{figure}



% The theoretical maximum line ratios possible for pure stellar
% photoionization are shown as a dashed curve in Figure~\ref{fig:agn}
% \citep{kewley2001}. To be conservative, we use the
% \citet{kauffmann2003} empirical separation between active and
% star-forming galaxies (solid line). We find that in 2 of our \lya\
% emitters the gas is likely to be ionized by an active nucleus. We note
% that both cases are in the region of the diagram where stellar
% photoionization cannot be excluded on the basis of theoretical
% calculations \citep{kewley2001}.  Among the six galaxies that could
% not be placed on the BPT diagram, we could still classify 5 of them
% using either \nii/\ha\ ratio, or the line width. We identify the AGN
% as those galaxies for which $\log \left( [N~II] / H~\alpha \right)
% \geq -0.4$ \citep{miller2003,carter2001}.  We add 2 AGN based on the
% \nii/\ha\ ratio.  Finally, one of the two galaxies for which the \ha\
% is too red to be covered by our spectrum has an \oiii\ line width
% typical of an AGN ($\sim 1090$ \kms). To summarize, we identify 5 AGN
% out of a sample of 30 galaxies, i.e, the fraction of \lya\ emitters
% classified as AGN is 17\%, consistent with the recent measurement by
% \citep[][15\%]{cowie2009}, and marginally consistent with the
% measurement by \citet[][43$^{+18}_{-26}\%$]{finkelsteinagn}. However,
% Finkelstein et al. (2009) classify AGN using also the presence of high
% ionization emission lines, that may be indicative of a high-excitation
% star forming galaxy, rather than an active nucleus.

% In the following analysis we only consider those 20 galaxies that are
% classified as star-forming, and with {\it both} \ha\ and \hb\ detected
% in the spectrum.


% The proposed target GALEX \lya\ emitters
% stand as the first unbiased and statistically meaningful sample of
% \lya\ emitting galaxies at low redshift.

\section{Observations and data analysis}\label{sec:data}

The galaxies were observed between February and October 2011, with the
COS FUV, medium-resolution G160 grating. Each galaxy was observed for 1
orbit. For 22 out of the 25 galaxies, the imaging target acquisition
was performed on a star close to the science target (distance $\le
2$'). The telescope was then offset to center the COS aperture on the
science target. The offsets were computed from ground based images in
most cases, while ACS HST imaging was used for the objects in the
COSMOS field (see Table~\ref{tab:info}). In order to check the
acquisition procedure, we obtained a direct NUV image after the
telescope was shifted to te target position.  The exposure times of
the images vary between 80 and 200 seconds, depending on the GALEX NUV
magnitude of the target. The remainder of each orbit was used for the
spectroscopic observations in TIME-TAG mode, with typical exposure
times of 2300s.  We chose the grating central wavelength to ensure that
the \lya\ would not fall in the wavelength gaps due to the physical
layout of the detectors and the optics. In order to reduce the
impact of microchannel plate detector fixed pattern noise, we took two
exposures for each target, with FP-POS$=3$ and FP-POS$=4$,
respectively. The wavelength range covered by the COS spectra is
approximately $1405-1775$\AA, with a dispersion of 12.23~m\AA\
px$^{-1}$. 
                        
We calibrated and extracted the COS spectra using {\tt calcos}
v2.15.4 task in {\tt pyraf}. Due to the target acquisition strategy, the
galaxies were not perfectly centered in the COS aperture. We used the
direct NUV images of the targets to measure the shifts in the dispersion direction
between the position of the center of each galaxy and the expected
position of the COS aperture center. The shifts ranged between $-19$
and 10 NUV pixels, with a standard deviation of 8 pixels
(corresponding to 0.1\AA). The correction to the wavelength zero
point was applied to the wavelength column in the {\tt corrtag} files,
and {\tt calcos} was the run again with the edited files as
input. This correction does not only take care of the wavelength zero
point, but also allows us to apply the proper sensitivity at each
wavelength.

\begin{figure*}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.46]{NUV_fluxes.ps}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{Lya_GALEX_COS.ps}
  \caption{Comparison between the total luminosities as measured by GALEX 
	and COS. The \emph{Left} panel shows the continuum fluxes in monochromatic
	units, while the \emph{Right} panel shows \lya. Large
    points have been corrected using the aperture correction estimated
    from the UV continuum. Open large squares indicate galaxies
    observed with MIRROR-B. After the aperture correction,
    approximately 30\% of the \lya\ flux is missed by the 2\farcs5 COS
    aperture, indicating that the \lya\ emission is more extended than
    the continuum.}
  \label{fig:GALEX_COSflux}
\end{figure*}

The PSA aperture throughput decreases toward the edges of the field of
view, due to the increasing vignetting of the flux. This change in
throughput is not accounted for in the {\tt calcos} pipeline, which 
is optimized for point sources, and results in an underestimate of 
the extracted flux for extended
sources. We scaled the extracted spectra by a correction factor
computed using the directing imaging, and assuming that the aperture
throughput is symmetric with respect to the aperture center. The
scaling factors vary between 1.15 and 1.45, for the most compact and
most extended sources, respectively. In Figure~\ref{fig:GALEX_COSflux}
we compare the total aperture corrected NUV flux measured from the COS
images within the 2\farcs5 aperture with the GALEX NUV total flux. The
fluxes in the smaller COS apertures are systematically lower than the
GALEX fluxes, indicating that 


For four galaxies (see Table~\ref{tab:sample}) the star used for the
acquisition was too bright to be observed with MIRRORA. In these cases
we performed the acquisition using MIRRORB and changed to MIRRORA for the
science exposures. Although the change from MIRRORB to MIRRORA does not
affect a target's relative location in the aperture, it does move the
location of the aperture on the detector, making it impossible to measure
the precise target's location in the aperture, even if a direct image
was obtained after the shift. Because the zero point of the wavelength
calibration depends on the position of the galaxy in the aperture, for
these four galaxies we added a systematic error component to the
wavelength calibration, equal to the standard deviation of the
galaxies' centers in the dispersion direction ( 0.1\AA, c.f.t. above).

 position of the COS 2\farcs5 aperture on the object. For four galaxies the
 position could not be determined (see text for detail).}
  \label{fig:images}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Measurement of line flux and wavelength of line peak}\label{sect:peakmeas}

We show the \lya\ profiles of the sample galaxies in
Figure~\ref{fig:spectra_full}.  The profiles are characterized by complex
structure and asymmetric shape.  For this reason, rather than fitting
a single gaussian, we measure the total line flux by integrating the
profile between $\pm 2.5$\AA\ from the expected line center. We
estimate the continuum by computing the median flux density within
2\AA\ on both sides of the line center. The line-flux error was
computed from the error spectrum derived during the spectral
extraction process.  In Figure~\ref{fig:GALEX_COSflux} we also compare the
total, aperture--corrected \lya\ flux from the COS spectra, with the
line intensity derived in \citet{cowie2011}. The aperture--correction
was estimated using the acquisition images, as explained in
Section~\ref{sec:data}. The comparison between the GALEX and COS
measurements is informative, because the two instruments have
different aperture size. 



For each galaxy, we also derived the wavelength
corresponding to the peak(s) of the \lya\ line profile, derived by
fitting a Gaussian function to a small wavelength range ($\pm 0.6$\AA)
centered around the visually identified position of the peak. For the
four objects for which MIRROR-B was used in the acquisition process,
errors in the peak wavelength include the $0.1$\AA\ centering
uncertainty.  Hereafter we will use blue (red) peak, to identify the
peak on the blue(red) side of the \lya\ wavelength expected from \ha\
redshift. In Table~\ref{tab:measurements} we report the total line
flux, and the wavelength of the blue and red peak(s).


\subsection{Size measurement}
We use the COS images to measure the sizes of the galaxies in the NUV.
Because of the complicated morphology of the starforming regions in
many of the galaxies, we cannot fit a smooth profile to the UV light
distribution (e.g., GALEX0332$-$2811A). We have therefore computed the
radius of the circular aperture containing half of the total NUV
flux. The centers used for the circular apertures are indicated with a
cross in Figure~\ref{fig:images}.  Because of the small aperture of
the COS instrument, we use the GALEX NUV luminosity as an estimate of
the total light of the galaxy. Before computing the aperture flux, we
multiplied each NUV image by the COS aperture response map to account
for the decreasing throughput as function of the spatial offset from
the aperture center \citep{Goudfrooij2010}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{UV-morphology}
Being sensitive to light between 1600 and 3100\AA, the COS NUV channel
images mostly probe the continuum coming from the hot young stars.
%***MH
\lya\ is inside the NUV bandpass for only three of our galaxies, (those 
at at $z>0.31$), where the EW is anyway insufficient to dominate the 
global light, but could in principle extend the morphologies somewhat.
Figure~\ref{fig:images} we show the HST NUV
images of the 25 galaxies observed with COS, together with the
position of the circular COS aperture (when it could be determined,
see section~\ref{sec:data}). The galaxies show a variety of morphology
in the NUV: in some objects (e.g., GALEX1417$+$5305 in
Figure~\ref{fig:images}) the UV light is distributed smoothly over a
large part of the COS aperture (i.e., diffuse objects), in others
(e.g., GALEX1417$+$5228) the light is concentrated in a single compact
star cluster (i.e., compact objects), while in others (e.g.,
GALEX1000$+$0157) the light is distributed in multiple clumps.  The
morphological classification is reported in Table~\ref{tab:xxx}.

\subsection{Ly$\alpha$ profiles}


In Figure~\ref{fig:spectra_full} we present the full COS spectra
shifted into the rest-frame using the redhift measured from the \ha\
emission line. The spectra are boxcar smoothed using a box of 1\AA,
and are shifted in the vertical direction for clarity.  The horizontal
dashed lines \textbf{(i don't see any horizontal lines)} show the zero flux level corresponding to each galaxy
spectrum. Rest-frame UV spectra of starforming galaxies are
characterized by strong absorption features from both the neutral and
ionized interstellar medium and by P-Cygni profile lines typical of
radiation driven winds in massive stars. In about half of the sample
galaxies, we can identify the strongest rest-frame UV features.
However, because of the low S/N of the spectra, an accurate analysis
is not possible.

\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}[h!]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=.44]{delta_v.ps}
   \caption{Histogram of the velocity shifts between the 
\lya\ and \ha\ lines. The blue histogram shows the shifts for our GALEX LAEs

	 $\langle z \rangle=2.65$ LBGs from Steidel et al (2010). The arrow shows 
	 the shift of 104 km/s measuerd in the stacked spectrum shown in 
	 Figure~\ref{fig:stack}.}
   \label{fig:histvel}
\end{figure}

\textbf{(eh? which box smoothing is it? this or last paragraph?)}
In Figure~\ref{fig:spectra_full} we show the observed COS spectra
centered on the galaxy systemic velocity derived using the \ha\
emission line. The spectra are shown after a 9 pixels ($\sim$0.1\AA)
boxcar average. In two galaxies (GALEX1418$+$5259 and
GALEX0959$+$0149) the \lya\ line is very faint, and it is detected
only after a rather heavy boxcar smoothing ($\sim 0.7$\AA).

From the images shown in Figure~\ref{fig:images} we cans 
In Figures~\ref{fig:spectra_full} we show the profiles of the \lya\
emission lines. The vertical dashed line shows the expected wavelength
position of the \lya\ based on optical-lines redshift measurements.
In a clear majority of cases ($\sim 20$ of 25) the peak of the \lya\ 
line is notably offset in wavelegnth to the red of the systemic 
velocity. In some cases multiple peaks are also visible, with a 
tendency (at least 10 cases) to show an additional peak on the blue
side of the main peak, and also clearly bluewards of the systemic
velocity. A handful of galaxies show additional red peaks that 
that are clearly separated in three cases, and also extended bumps 
in the red wings of the primary line that could also be indicative of 
extended red features. 

Using the measured wavelengths of the strongest \lya\ emission peak, 
we compute offsets relative to \ha. These values are presented also in
Table~\ref{tab:xxx} and range generally between $-50$ and $+350$ km/s
and take a mean velocity shift of $121\pm 18$ km/s (standard error on
the mean). We present this veloctiy distribution in the form of a 
histogram in Figure~\ref{fig:histvel}. 

\subsection{Continuum properties of the sample}

The observations were designed to target the \lya\ line, and 
consequently the continuum is not well exposed in individual galaxies. 
Sample-averaged inferences can, however, be made through a stacking
analysis. We blueshift the observed spectra into the rest-frame using
the measured \ha\ velocities, and compute mean and median unweighted 
averages. The mean/median stacked UV spectrum can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:stack}. 

\begin{figure*}[t!]

   \includegraphics[scale=.6]{Nstack.eps}
   \caption{Composite spectrum from XXX galaxies. {\bf COULD BE GOOD TO SHOW THE NUMBER OF CONTRIBUTED FRAMES?}}
   \label{fig:stack}
\end{figure*}

We are able to identify and clearly measure the features that we identify in 
Table~\ref{tab:abs}. That includes five lines that form in the ISM
and one (C{\sc iii}$\lambda 1175$) that is mainly photospheric. It is 
reassuring that the velocity shift of the C{\sc iii} is close to zero, as
would be expected for the stellar population but the ISM lines, on the other
hand, all show blueshifted outflow velocities in the range of 150--200 km/s. 

In the same stacked spectrum we measure a peak wavelength of \lya, which we 
find to be redshifted by 104 km/s -- fully consistent with the mean \lya\ 
velocity shift of the sample (121 km/s).

\subsection{Profile properties in various cases}

Let $x$ be :
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{\nu - \nu_0}{\Delta \nu_D};
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\nu_D=V_{th}/c\nu_)$ is the Doppler frequency width.

\noindent
{\bf Homogeneous slab, monocromatic radiation} 
What determines the shape of the output spectrum in this case are the
temperature and the optical depth of the neutral medium.
For a dust-free slab, the profile is double peaked and simmetric
around $x=0$. The peak frequency in this case ($x_p$) depends on $T$
and $\tau_0$ (the optical depth at the line center),
with $x_p \sim \pm 0.88(a\tau_0)^1/3$. The more optically thick the
medium is the more the peaks are separated.

In the presence of dust, the profile does not change much.

{\bf Expanding infalling halos}
The \lya\ profiles resulting from a monochromatic source surroundes by
an expanding/infalling shell of gas are perfectly symmetric to
each other. Expanding halos present a red peak while infalling halos
show a blue peak.

\section{Discussion} 

\subsection{Lyman alpha scattering in galaxy outflows} 

It is frequently noted that \lya, when found in emission, presents as 
a feature systematically redshifted from its systemic velocity 
(Kunth et al 1998, Shapley et al 2003, Tapken et al 2004, McLinden et al 2011). 
P\,Cygni-like \lya\ profiles are thought to arise by scattering in neutral
gas that has been accelerated by mechanical energy returned from the star
formation episode (Ahn \& Lee XXX, Verhamme et al 2006). Our measured velocity
shift for the interstellar absorption lines (150--200 km/s) places our stacked
galaxy somewhere in the middle of the distribution for star-forming galaxies
in the nearby universe selected for observation with HST (Leitherer et al 2011),
suggesting they are not providing extreme feedback compared to their gas 
masses.  Indeed the velocity shift of the LIS absorption lines compared with 
\ha\ is also very similar to the sample average of 164~km/s measured in LBGs 
at $z\sim 2.7$ (Steidel et al 2010). 

Regarding \lya\ emission, radiative transport modeling has suggested that 
characteristic offsets to 
\lya\ should exceed the blue-shifting of the neutral ISM offsets by factors 
of around
two (Verhamme et al 2008). Measuring neutral ISM lines in faint \lya-selected
high-z galaxies is usually beyond the limits of the data in most LAE 
spectroscopic observations, but recently a number of \lya\ velocity offsets
have been measured with respect to \ha\ and [OIII] lines: McLinden et al
(2011) report offsets of 125 and 342 km/s for the two galaxies; Finkelstein
et al (2011) report a 162 km/s offset in one galaxy and another that is 
consistent with zero; Hashimoto et al (2012) present four more galaxies with
$\Delta v_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ between 0 and 200 km/s; Guaita et al (submitted)
present four more galaxies with offsets between 100 and 350~km/s. Our sample
of 25 $\langle z\rangle=0.2$ LAEs is twice the size of the combined samples
at $z=2-3$ and find a very similar distribution of \lya\ velocity offsets, 
and suggests this offset to be somewhat characteristic of the \lya-selected
galaxy population, independent of redshift.

Similarly made measurments in continuum-selected galaxies at $z\sim 2.7$
find average absorption line offsets that match that measured in
our stacked spectrum with surprising accuracy. It is of marked interest, 
therefore, that \lya-\ha\ offsets measured in the same sample of almost 100
LBGs (Steidel et al 2010, see also Kulas et al 2012) find a an average 
$\Delta v_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ four times the value that we measure in the 
more nearby Universe. While
the average offset of \lya\ compared with the LIS lines for LBGs appears 
consistent with predictions from radiative trasport models our average 
measurement of a \lya\ offset significantly below the LIS offset is in stark
contrast to predictions. 

A plausible reconciliation of \lya\ shifts below the outflow 
velocities of the oncoming gas may lie in exactly where in the HI medium
\lya\ obtains its redistribution in frequency.
A measurement of the LIS lines will return the velocity at which the column 
density of the absorbing species -- and presumably also neutral hydrogen -- 
is highest. For typical column densities in star-forming galaxies this may 
be on the order of $10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (Mas-Hesse et al 2003). In static 
gas, \lya\ becomes optically
thick at column densities roughly 6 orders of magnitude below this value, which 
suggests that the gas responsible for the frequency distribution is both of lower
column density and velocity than the bulk of the outflowing gas, and also resides 
closer to the recombination nebulae. Yet this scenario is not able to explain
the marked difference seen between the \lya\ and UV selected populations: why
should the situation be different in the two populations? It is plausible also 
that we are observing the transition between \lya\ photons that have been 
backscattered from receeding shells (which must acquire around twice the
velocity shift of the outflowing gas) and photons that are able to pass directly
through the oncoming shell. The multiple peaking of many of the \lya\ profiles 
is indeed also suggestive of this: indeed it appears that we are observing 
a large number of double-peaked profiles, in which the red peak is enhanced 
compared to the blue. From the available publications of transport modeling, 
this seems most resemblant of photon transfer and frequency redistribution
in a single front-side medium. 

\subsection{What drives the velocity shift?} 

If the \lya\ velocity shift is present, and the neutral gas observed to 
be accelerated, then one may expect the feedback to be coupled with other
properties of the star-formation episode. 
 Specifically, for example, outflows may be stronger in 
galaxies of higher SFR or specific SFR which in turn may manifest in 
larger velocity offsets. Adopting the \ha\ luminosity as a proxy for SFR
and its equivalent width as a rougher proxy for sSFR, we present the \lya\ 
velocity shift compared with L(\ha) and EW(\ha) in the upper two panels
of Figure~\ref{fig:dvha}. 

\begin{figure}[t!]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=.4]{dvel_ha.eps}
   \caption{The \lya-\ha\ velocity shift compared with 
			 (a. \emph{Upper left}) the \ha\ luminosity; 
			 (b. \emph{Upper right}) \ha\ equivalent width; 
			 (c. \emph{Lower left}) N2 index; 
			 (d. \emph{Lower right}) gas phase metallicity }
   \label{fig:dvha}
\end{figure}

The data present no such correlation of offset with SFR. Indeed while 
higher SFR must imply that more mechanical energy has been fed back to 
the ISM, it does not necessarily mean that the outflow would be faster. 
SFR and stellar mass are known to be strongly correlated 
in almost all galaxy samples, and should the neutral gas mass also scale
with stellar mass, proportionally more energy would be needed 
to drive a superwind of the same velocity. In this picture, a correlation 
with SFR would not be expected, but one would expect a stronger velocity 
offset when the SFR per unit mass, or sSFR, increases. Interestingly, then, 
the plot of $\Delta v(\mathrm{Ly}\alpha)$ against $EW(\mathrm{H}\alpha)$ shows 
a marked lower envelope consistent with this formulation. Galaxies with low 
equivalent widths ($\lesssim 100$\AA) can 
take the full range of outflow velocities (0 -- 200 km/s), whereas galaxies with
high sSFR ($EW$(\ha) $>200$~\AA: eight of 22 measureable galaxies) present only 
with $\Delta v(\mathrm{Ly}\alpha)$ 
above the sample average value of 100 km/s.  It is plausible
therefore, that since these galaxies have high SFR compared with their stellar mass, 
their SFRs may also be high compared with their neutral gas mass and are able to
push the \lya\ scattering medium to higher velocities. 

From the optical spectra we also compute the N2 index 
[$\equiv$ log$_{10}$(\nII6584/\ha)] and the gas-phase metallicity which we derive 
from the O3N2 index using the strong line calibration of calbiration of 
(Pettini \& Pagel 2004). Here also there appears to be a rough anti-correlation 
between $\Delta v(\mathrm{Ly}\alpha)$ and {N2,O/H}. However we note that the 
emission line measuements involve no quantitiy sensitive to the mass of the stellar 
population. Metallicitiy does, however, correlate strongly with stellar mass, 
implying that velocity shifts are somewhat higher in lower mass objects. 
This aligns well with the reasoning presented above, in explaining how a large 
range of offsets may be observed, despite showing no overall correlation with 
the total star formation rate. 


\subsection{How would a neutral Universe effect these observations?}

In high-redshift studies, \lya\ fluxes, number counts, luminosity functions, 
and asymmetries are all thought to be affected by the increasingly neutral 
fraction of hydrogen in the neutral IGM. However, disentangling possible IGM
effects from those of the ISM has never been possible in these galaxy samples. 
In our $\langle z\rangle=0.2$ observatations we can perform a number of 
comparison studies on a set of observations for which we can be certain that 
the IGM has no influence on the \lya\ line. We now proceed to examine how 
common assumptions about the IGM affect \lya\ photometry and measurments of the 
profile asymmetry. 


\subsubsection{Photometry in an ionized and neutral universe}

One of the primary use of the \lya\ line in astrophysical cosmology is as a 
diagnostic of the reionization epoch, as an increasingly high fraction of 
intergalactic gas becomes neutral with increasing redshift 
(Miralda-Escude 1998; Haiman \& Spaans 1999; Malhotra \& Rhoads 2006; 
Kashikawa et al. 2006). Furthermore, should one want to derive the 
intrinsic \lya\ output of a galaxy (before IGM attenuation) one needs to
correct for the IGM. Indeed frequently, simple prescriptions (e.g. Madau 2005) 
for the IGM are applied directly to the \lya\ line to make this correction 
(Cassata et al 2011; Blanc et al 2011), which accounts for almost 50\% of the 
\lya\ flux at $z=6$. This is the entire premise for the recent claim of an 
extremely high EW \lya\ emitter at $z=6.5$ (Kashikawa et al 2012). 
These corrections include two major unknown questions: 
by how much is the \lya\ line offset redward of its systemic velocity? and 
how close do the \lya\ forest clouds really come to the \lya\ line? With these
data we have already answered the former question, and we will now proceed with
a simple assessment of how common assumptions of the latter may affect 
conclusions. 

Using the systemic redshift for our sample as measured by \ha\ and the 
canonical prescription for intergalactic Lyman series line blanketing 
of Madua (1995), we simulate or \lya\ spectra in the common redshift windows 
of $z=5.7$ and $6.5$. We simply blueshift the galaxies to $z=0$ and redshift
them to the high-z windows, apply the IGM, and re-compute the luminosities 
using the same method as in Table~\ref{tab:measurements}. We present the 
luminosities, both unattenuated and suppressed by the $z=5.7$ and 6.5 IGM, 
in Table~\ref{tab:hiz_asym}, and make a graphical comparison in 
Figure~\ref{fig:igmlum}. 

\begin{figure*}[t!]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=.65]{lumcomp_igm.eps}
   \caption{Comparison of the measured luminosity of \lya, with the same measurements 
	when the spectra have been `absorbed' by the standard Madau (1995) IGM  prescription
	 assuming redshift $z=5.7$ (\emph{left}) and $z=6.5$ (\emph{right}). The lower panels
	 show a direct comparison of the luminosities, while the upper panels show the 
	 fractional luminosity that is transmitted through the IGM. By eye the \emph{left} 
	and \emph{right} plots are indsitinguishable. The dotted lines show the average 
	ratios of $L\{5.7,6.5\} = 0.81L(z=0)$, which differ only at the fourth significant 
  digit. Shaded regions show the standard error on the mean, which is almost consistent
	with the 1:1 line. 
\vspace{5mm}	 }
   \label{fig:igmlum}
\end{figure*}

Immediately it can be seen that the simulated high-$z$ luminosities lie very close 
to the total measured fluxes. Only in a handful of cases -- obviously the few 
galaxies with symmetric \lya\ lines centred around the systemic velocity -- is there
a significant suppression of the \lya\ line by the IGM. Indeed the majority of \lya\
profiles shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spectra_full} are noteably redshifted, with only 
a small component to the total flux provided by the blue peak. The effect of the IGM 
is essentially to completely remove the blue peak but leave the redshifted, dominant 
peak almost completely unaffected. We compute the average values of 
$L$(\lya,IGM) / $L$(\lya,noIGM), which evaluates to $0.81 \pm 0.17$ (standard error 
on the mean) at both tested redshifts. It is possible that additional flux could be 
suppressed by the red damping wing of a neutral IGM that has not been accounted for 
by these models. This would further suppress our \lya\ luminosities in the simulated 
spectra, but it should be noted that this is not usually accounted for either by 
high-$z$ observational studies. The damping wing would have equal additional effect 
on high-$z$ data and these simulations. With so many galaxies lying close to the 
1:1 line, we find no argument for doubling observed $z\gtrsim 6$ fluxes, especially
in individual cases. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that asymmetries
do not differ at high- and low-$z$, as we will discuss in the next section.



\subsubsection{\lya\ asymmetry in an ionized universe}

As well as applying a redward velocity offset to the transferred \lya\ line, 
scattering in netural gas is also well-known to introduce asymmetries to the 
profile itself.  In the spectra of high-$z$ 
galaxies, when spectral resolution permits, \lya\ almost ubiquitously 
presents asymmetrically (Shapley et al 2003; Kurk et al. 2004; 
Shimasaku et al 2006) and, at the highest redshifts, is expected to be
enhanced by neutral gas in the IGM. Indeed, quantitative measurements of
the profile asymmetry have also been invoked to discriminate between 
\lya\ emitting galaxies and foreground interloperes (e.g. [OII] emitters
where the line is not subject to radiative transport effects; Kashikawa 
et al 2006). As with the transmitted line flux, however, the effect that
the IGM has on the transmitted line is strongly dependent upon how close
the IGM comest to the \lya\ line that is transported through the ISM. 

\begin{figure*}[t!]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[scale=.8]{asym_hist.eps}
   \caption{Distribution of the weighted skewness $S_W$ of our COS \lya\ 
	profiles. Histograms of our own sample are presented in black, scaled 
	in redshift to $z=5.7$ (\emph{left}) and 6.5 (\emph{right}). Overplotted
	in the \emph{left} panel are the LAEs from Shimasaku et al (2006) in red,
 and the emission line objects determined to be lower redshift interlopers in
	blue. In the right panel the red histogram shows the LAEs of Kashikawa et
	al (2006). Labeled in the figures are the probabilities that the 
	high-$z$ samples ($z=5.7$ LAEs, LAEs+interlopers, and $z=6.5$ LAEs) are drawn

	sum comparison. It shows the LAEs populations to be indistinguishable but 
	LAE+interlopers are clearly unlikely to share an underlying distribution.
	 }
   \label{fig:skew}
\end{figure*}

Our well resolved and high $S/N$ COS observations give us the possibility
to compute quantitative asymmetries for a sample of \lya\ selected galaxies
in which we can say with certainty that the frequency redistribuion occurs 
inside the ISM. We opt to measure profile skewness (Kurk et al 2004), 
`weighted skewness' (Shimasaku et al 2006) and red/blue ratios of the 
peak-to-10\% wavelength and flux (Rhoads et al 2003). We are able to perform
these measurements in 22 of our 25 objects, and present the resutls in 
Table~\ref{tab:hiz_asym}. 

Firstly regarding weighted skewness, the index has been used by Shimasaku 
et al (2006) at $z=5.7$ and Kashikawa et al (2006) at $z=6.5$ to cull 
interloping galaxies from their sample, by invoking a threshold $S_W$ of $>3$ 
to select LAEs. Scaling our measurments of $S_W$ into the observer frame at
these redshifts we present histograms of the $S_W$ for the COS sample in
Figure~\ref{fig:skew}. Overplotted are the LAE and low-$z$ samples of Shimasaku, 
and LAEs measured and compiled in Kashikawa et al. It is immediately clear from
these histograms that our GALEX-selected LAEs exhibit a very similar range of 
$S_W$ to both high-$z$ LAEs samples, whereas the interloping sample of 
Shimasaku et al (2006) shows very little clear overlap. In order to assess 
this similarity quantitatively, we employ a $K-$sample Anderson--Darling (1952) 
rank sum comparison \footnote{The A--D test is similar to the frequently adopted
Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K--S) test but  considers the full range of data values as 
opposed to the largest single deviation, and is therefore more robust against
strong biases from outlying points.}. Indeed for the two LAE samples, data are 
consistent with the null hypothesis (that the two samples are drawn from the 
same parent distribution)  at only the 28\% level ($z=5.7$) and 69\% ($z=6.5$)
level. However the same test performed on the concatenated LAE+interloper 
sample at $z=5.7$ suggests there is a $<3$\% chance the the two samples 
share the same parent distribution, and the selection of $S_W>3$ as invoked
in those studies seems appropriate. It seems likely, however, that the asymmetry
is introduced by the scattering of \lya\ photons within the ISM of these galaxies
and not by an encroaching neutral IGM. If the IGM does not have an appreciable 
effect of the asymmetry of the \lya\ line at high-$z$ it must reflect the fact
that the \lya\ forest does not come cloes enough to \lya\ to sufficiently 
affect the blue wing, possibly becuase of redshifting within the ISM, which is
certainly very consistent with a reduction in flux of only $\sim 20$~\% as shown
in the previous Section. If it has an effect at all, it must be very grey, and 
likely be caused only by the damping wing.
